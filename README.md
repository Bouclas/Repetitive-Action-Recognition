# Repetitive-Action-Recognition
This is the official repository housing the material that are exploited in the journal article "Exploiting the Nature of Repetitive Actions fortheir Effective and Efficient Recognition". We provide guidelines regarding the steps that were followed to generate the datasets that are used in this work, as well as any important documentation on the aspects of the proposed Human Activity Recognition (HAR) pipeline.
